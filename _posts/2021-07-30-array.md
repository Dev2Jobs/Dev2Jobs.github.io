# @[] @{}

First one @[] is a shorthand to create an Array, for example the following array of two elements:

NSArray *array = @[ @"First", @"Second"];
Second one @{} creates a dictionary, for example:

NSDictionary *dictionary = @{
    @"first" : someValue,
    @"second" : someValue,
};

===========================================================================================

@{} is equal to [NSDictionary dictionary]

@[] is equal to [NSArray array]

so [@[] mutableCopy] creates an empty immutable object and then it makes a mutablecopy of it. I don't think you can do it less efficient.

===========================================================================================

No. @[] is equal to [NSArray array] or [[NSArray alloc] init].
No. @{} is equal to [NSDictionary dictionary] or [[NSDictionary alloc] init].
(depending on the context and whether you use Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) or not)

That's why you see things like [@[] mutableCopy] sometimes. This will create an empty immutable array and create a mutable copy of it.

The result is the same as using [NSMutableDictionary dictionary] or [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init].
